In today's cloud computing industry, data is essential to understand your business, your customer and your system. In my experience, 
it usually boils down to analyzing a key performance indicator (KPI) in terms of a set of aspects. For example, I might be interested in the number of 
activities performed by a user, and I might want to know how that is correlated with the user's gender, region s/he lives in, and the client used.

There are many ways I can use that data. I might be interested in comparing the KPI by user gender first, then by the client types, or by the regions
first, then by the genders, etc. This could all be done writing scripts. But Excel PivotTable can be handy in such scenarios.

Suppose [this is my data source](https://github.com/kflu/kflu.github.io/files/160868/stats.txt). The following screencast illustrates the use of PivotTable to analyze it.

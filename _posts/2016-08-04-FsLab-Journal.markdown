FsLab Journal is a literate programming tool based on FSharp.Formatting. It's sort of like Jupyter notebook. The advantage of it over IPython notebook
is that it's statically typed and IDE supports are awesome. In order to use it:

1. Download the template from [here](https://github.com/fslaborg/FsLab.Templates/archive/journal.zip)
2. Run `build run` to automatically restore packages and start a live server
2. Unzip and open the `.fsproj` file to start editing in Visual Studio
3. The web page is automatically updated (there's a several seconds delay)

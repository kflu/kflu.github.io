<p>This is Max, a 6 year old Golden Retriever that I adopted when he was
a little puppy. He and I both love outdoors and we have such a close
binding that he'd beg me to take him whenever I'm going out. I try to
take him to wherever I go as much as possible - going on a hike,
paddle boarding on the water, shopping in the mall, etc. But the
reality is, in an area as pet friendly as Seattle, there're a lot of
places that don't welcome dogs, mostly the restaurants and the grocery
stores.</p>
<p><img src="pup.jpg" alt="the pup"></p>
<p>If we go out for a day in urban area, he most likely will be staying
in the car during lunch time. When it comes to pet safety, I'm a
little paranoid as most pet owner would be. When leaving him in the
car, I make sure to park in the shade, have the sunroof open, wind the
windows down, etc. But no matter how much I do, when I sit in the
restaurants I always worry about the temperature in the car.</p>
<p><strong>Until one day I decided to do something about it - making a in-car,
wireless real-time temperature monitor, which transmits periodic
readings to the receiver that I carry with me. This gives me a piece
of mind knowing that my pup is staying safely and comfortably in the
car!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong> <em>Please be responsible when leaving your pet in the car.
Refer to <a href="http://blog.gopetfriendly.com/is-it-illegal-to-leave-your-pet-alone-in-the-car/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the laws</a> in different states that allows or prohibits leaving
animal in motor vehicle in certain situations.</em></p>
<p>Before going into the details, here's what I built using several
weekends and less than $100:</p>
<p><img src="IMG_2523.JPG.small.jpg" alt="device"></p>
<p>On the right is the transmitter. It stays in the car that
sends the temperature readings every 5 seconds. On the left is the
receiver, I take it when leaving my pup in the car. The receiver has a
little LED that blinks a certain number of times to indicate the
temperature in the car. Both devices run on battery and have a
transmission range of around 250m (820ft) in very complex building
environment (shopping mall), with primitive (poor man's) wire antenna.</p>
<h1>High Level Design Decisions</h1>
<p>The overall system design is based on <a href="https://www.lora-alliance.org/What-Is-LoRa/Technology" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LoRa wireless technology</a>.
It uses spread spectrum communication and has advanced technology to
combat channel fading and interference. In ideal situation it's
claimed to have miles of transmission range. Initially I was
considering Family Radio Service (FRS) (used by walkie talkie)
for its long communication range. But I couldn't find good
hardware and software support for it. <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/pages/xbee_guide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XBee</a> seems to be a good
alternative. With the &quot;Pro&quot; version, XBee claims to have miles of
transmission range. But the cost of XBee Pro chips seem to be much
higher than the Lora modules.</p>
<p>Basically I need a system to perform measuring, transmitting,
receiving, and displaying the temperature data between 2 peers. I knew
I should choose Arduino boards over RaspberryPi, because the tasks are
simple and <em>the power consumption must be low</em> in order to make at
least the receiver mobile.</p>
<p>I had no previous experience with Arduino programming and soldering
circuits. My major was in wireless communication back in college and
had college level knowledge on circuits. Programming was trivial as
I'm already a programmer:) And this was a pretty fun experience!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.adafruit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adafruit</a> is an awesome website teaching how to do all sorts of
Arduino things and also sells the devices. What I like most is on each
product page it also offers the tutorial on how to assemble, wire, and
program it! It made my first hardware project much smoother than I'd
imagined.</p>

<p><strong>Note that:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When buying LoRa modules, please make sure to buy the frequency
according to the regulation of your country. In US, LoRa uses 915MHz.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The cost can be significantly cut down from this list. My
choice of the products were not solely for cutting down the price, but
more for better learning experience, community support, flexibility in
prototyping. For example, Adafruit has <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/3178" target="_blank" rel="noopener">feather board integrated with
LoRa chip</a> (or <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/3078" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this</a>). They are cheaper than buying the board
and LoRa module separately. And it also eliminates almost all the
soldering work.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The board and the LoRa module are wired together using SPI interface.
I'm not going into the detail. Please refer to <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-rfm69hcw-and-rfm96-rfm95-rfm98-lora-packet-padio-breakouts/wiring" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adafruit tutorial</a>.</p>
<h1>Measuring the temperature</h1>
<p>Using the TMP36 temperature sensor is extremely easy. It's done by
using the MCU to measure the output voltage of the sensor. Most
importantly, the input voltage to the sensor must be stable for the
measurement to be accurate. Since I'll be using USB power on the
transmitter side, and the USB power bank is stable at 5v, I don't have
difficulty here.</p>
<p>For more information about using TMP36, refer to Adafruit <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/tmp36-temperature-sensor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TMP36 product
page</a>.</p>
<h1>Displaying the temperature</h1>
<p>You may have noticed that the receiver doesn't have a display. Yes -
this was my first Arduino project and I didn't have time to learn and
investigate everything at one shot. I decided to go simple and hacky.
On every Arduino board, there is a tiny cute built-in LED that can be
programmed (I guess they have it because almost every beginner's first
project is to program the LED to blink). Using the built-in LED has
two advantages - it's simple to program, and uses minimum power than
almost any other fancier display.</p>
<p>I quantize the temperature into 7 regions, each have a different
number of quick blinks every 5 seconds. So I can know the temperature region
in the car by observing the number of quick blinks.</p>
<pre><code>int temp_to_comfort(float tempC) {
    if (               tempC &lt; 0)  return 7;
    if ( 0 &lt;= tempC &amp;&amp; tempC &lt; 20) return 1;
    if (20 &lt;= tempC &amp;&amp; tempC &lt; 25) return 2;
    if (25 &lt;= tempC &amp;&amp; tempC &lt; 30) return 3;
    if (30 &lt;= tempC &amp;&amp; tempC &lt; 35) return 4;
    if (35 &lt;= tempC &amp;&amp; tempC &lt; 40) return 5;
    if (40 &lt;= tempC)               return 6;
}
</code></pre>
<p>I did took sometime tweaking the speed of each blink - initially it
blinks a little too fast and I couldn't tell if it blinked 3 or 4 or
more times. Once I slow it down a little, it works pleasantly well!</p>
<p>I took this idea further and made my little LED a generic information
representation system. It can display all sorts of other information.
For example, a long, slow blink indicates no data is being received -
maybe the distance is too long, or the transmitter runs out of
battery.</p>
<p>Below animation shows it's receiving temperature in the 20°C ~ 25°C
range (2 blinks):</p>
<p><img src="LED_receiving.gif" alt="LED receiving"></p>
<p>Below animation shows it's not receiving any data (1 long slow blink):</p>
<p><img src="LED_error.gif" alt="LED error"></p>
<h1>Communication System</h1>
<p><a href="http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/arduino/RadioHead/classRH__RF95.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RadioHead</a> has awesome support for driving the LoRa modules. LoRa
technology operates at the physical and MAC layer. Since I only need a
peer to peer channel, I only used the physical layer functionality.</p>
<p>LoRa physical layer can be configured to use different frequency,
bandwidth, spreading factor, channel coding rate. These all affect the
data rate and communication range. Since I shoot for maximum
transmission range, and that the amount of data needed to be
transmitted is minimum, I chose to use the strongest error coding and
slowest data rate: bandwidth = 125kHz, coding rate = 4/8, spreading
factor = 4096chips/symbol, CRC on. For more detail on the LoRa
technical information, refer to <a href="http://www.semtech.com/images/datasheet/LoraDesignGuide_STD.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the LoRa Modem Designer's Guide</a>.</p>
<p>With this setting, I've done a couple of real life range testing. And
overall I'm very satisfied. The testing are mostly done in urban
locations such as malls or grocery stores, either on flat or hilly
terrains. The transmitter (<code>Tx</code>) was put in the car. The receiver
(<code>Rx</code>) was carried with me. I programmed the receiver to send the
receiving signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to the serial port, so by
attaching it to a computer and opening up the serial console, I can
know the exact level of channel fading and interference when the
signal is successfully received and decoded.</p>
<p><strong>Range Test 1: Library Underground Garage</strong></p>
<p>In library's underground parking, SNR dropped to -4dBm, but the signal
was decoded reliably.</p>
<p><img src="library.png" alt="library"></p>
<p><strong>Range Test 2: Mall</strong></p>
<p>This is the worst indoor channel I've tested so far in the Factoria
mall. The transmitter is in the outdoor parking lot. The receiver is
at almost the opposite side of the mall, 818ft away, across stores,
walls, and who-knows-what. I didn't record the SNR as I didn't have
laptop with me. I had to straiten the antenna in order to get the
signal and the signal dropped occasionally.</p>
<p><img src="mall.png" alt="mall"></p>
<p><strong>Range Test Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>I'm satisfied with the tests so far. What could be improved:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use proper antennas on transmitter and receiver</li>
<li>Use stateful receiver - remember the last successfully received data
and display it and the timestamp - it's acceptable as long as it
can receive from time to time. This requires a fancier display for
the data and the timestamp - I'd like to be aware of stale data.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Power Supply &amp; Battery Life</h1>
<p>Before this project, I didn't know how much there is in properly
designing a power supply! There're so many choices and limitations.</p>
<p>On the transmitter side, since it's always in the car, I could choose
to hook it up with my car's battery, as long as the input voltage is
in acceptable range. Note that it only makes sense to have a constant
power even if the ignition is not on. It could be done by tapping into
an unused fuse in the car, by using something like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004AHADOC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this</a>.</p>
<p>I chose a much easier option than that - since Arduino can be powered
by USB power, I used a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005X1Y7I2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">power bank</a>. Note that typical power
banks have &quot;auto-cutoff&quot; circuit that will cut off power after a
certain period of time if the payload device only draws very low
current. Fortunately, the transmission current is 200mA every 5
seconds. This is enough for the power bank to &quot;stay awake&quot;. As a
contrary, the receiver was cut off when powered by it. But I have a
better option for the receiver, detailed later.</p>
<p><img src="IMG_2524.JPG.small.jpg" alt="transmitter power"></p>
<p>On the transmitter, I measured the power consumption using a
multimeter:</p>
<ul>
<li>90mA in non-transmission mode</li>
<li>215mA in transmission mode</li>
</ul>
<p>For the 3350mAh power banks, the battery life is roughly:</p>
<pre><code>3350 * 0.75 / ( 90 + 215/5 ) = 18.9h
</code></pre>
<p>In a real test, I got 14.5hours life time.</p>
<p>On the receiver side, power consumption measurements are:</p>
<ul>
<li>0.03mA when idle</li>
<li>3.5mA when receiving</li>
</ul>
<p>I power it with 3xAAA battery (4.5v voltage which is ideal for the
feather 32u4 board). Estimated battery life:</p>
<pre><code>3 * 1000 * 0.75 / ( 0.03 + 3.5/5 ) = 3082h = 128 days
</code></pre>
<p>Below is a chart of the temperature reading and receiver's Signal-to-Noise
Ratio (SNR) over time. It is shown that temerature is well maintained constant
over most of the battery life, but only raised up (due to low voltage) at the
end of it. SNR is maintained over entire battery life and cut off when power is
not sufficient.</p>
<p><img src="temperature_time.png" alt="temp_time"></p>
<p><strong>Power optimization</strong></p>
<p>The board (MCU) could be put to sleep when not
transmitting to save power. This cuts the 90mA constant power draw.
This could be done <a href="http://donalmorrissey.blogspot.com/2010/04/sleeping-arduino-part-5-wake-up-via.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by using the MCU watchdog timer</a>.</p>
<h1>Device Enclosure</h1>
<p><strong>I was really concerned to bring this thing into crowded places</strong>.
Looking at it from an ordinary person's perspective - a bare circuit
board with some colorful wires and an antenna, taped to a black
battery case! In such a person's eyes, it'd look exactly like what a remote
control for some bomb in Hollywood movies would look like!</p>
<p>I didn't have time to learn designing and printing 3D printed cases.
What I did instead, is to wrap it with thin card board and stuff it in
the meshed bag that I got for the Anker power bank! The meshed fabric
really helps because I can see the LED through the bag when it's lit.</p>
<p><img src="package.png" alt="package"></p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>I made a remote temperature monitor that <strong>really works</strong>. It gives me
a piece of mind when having to leave my dog in the car, knowing that
the temperature is comfortable and safe for him. There're many
improvements that could be done. But it's the very first time I build
circuits and program at such a low level. Soldering is really fun, but
what's the most fun part? <strong>The moment when the LED blinked while the
transmitter was some hundreds of feet away!</strong></p>
